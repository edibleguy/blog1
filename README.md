[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yihui/travis-blogdown.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yihui/travis-blogdown)

A minimal example of building and deploying a blogdown-based website via Travis CI. For more information, please see this section in the **blogdown** book: https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/travis-github.html. (In short, I don't recommend you use this approach. Consider building your website locally, and [deploying through Netlify](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html) instead.
